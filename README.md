# pirsch-extended-unminified

This is an attempt to decode the full content of the "extended" [outbound link/download tracking](https://docs.pirsch.io/advanced/outbound-links) script offered by Pirsch (see it raw at [`https://api.pirsch.io/pirsch-extended.js`](https://api.pirsch.io/pirsch-extended.js)) in order to implement something similar in Umami (https://github.com/umami-software/umami/discussions/1140).
